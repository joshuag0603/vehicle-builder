# <vehicle-builder>

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate the functionality of the inquirer package. The application allows users to select or create a vehicle to perform actions with. I built this project because it allowed me to practice using the inquirer and typescript. During this project I learned how to implement classes from typescript and export them to be used across multiple files. 

## Installation

Run the command "npm i" in the terminal at the root level to install the npm packages for the project

## Usage

This project uses the inquirer package to prompt the user to create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. After going through this process, the user is able to perform specific actions with the selected vehicle based on it's vehicle type. The user returns to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.
